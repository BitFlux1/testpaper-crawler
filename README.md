## Project Overview

This project showcases my experience in **reverse engineering** and **web scraping**. Through analyzing a testing application from a well-known company, I explored its internal interfaces and data encryption methods. The aim of this project is to deepen understanding of complex application interface structures and data protection mechanisms, serving as a basis for technical research and knowledge development.

## Implementation Process

- **Interface Analysis**: Analyzed the target application’s communication interfaces and reconstructed the API through reverse engineering.
- **Encryption Decryption**: Successfully decrypted the encryption methods involved in request handling by examining communication data and encryption logic, enabling effective data retrieval.
- **Code Reversal**: Using **Frida** and **Jadx** tools, I decompiled the application code to understand its core encryption algorithms.

## Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates several key techniques:
- **Dynamic Debugging and Static Analysis**: Combined dynamic debugging and static analysis to optimize efficiency during reverse engineering.
- **Interface Reconstruction**: Fully reproduced the application’s interface logic, providing a robust foundation for web scraping.
- **Encryption Algorithm Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the app's specific encryption mechanisms, bypassing data encryption in communication protocols.
